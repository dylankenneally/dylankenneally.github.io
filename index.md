## Here's a few other items I've deployed here

These are all old & unmaintained little toy projects I've knocked up when I've been looking in to something or other, i.e. don'e expect any polish, bells or whistles.

<!-- todo: these would be best visualised as cards? -->

### Budget Planner

Last updated on 1 Jul 2019.
Was looking into Travis CI, i18next, & chart.js
UI was a rough clone of <a href="https://moneysmart.gov.au/budgeting/budget-planner" target="_blank">ASCI's Money Smart Budget Planner</a>, or it was at the time of writing.
