# [dylankenneally.github.io](https://dylankenneally.github.io/)

[GitHub pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages) experiments with  [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). Nothing to see here.

This repo is just a playground to help me get familiar with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and the updated automation pipeline in GitHub.

Anything interesting will be shown in the site that gets [deployed from this repo](https://dylankenneally.github.io/).

More interest thank this would be my [sire](https://www.dylankenneally.com) & my [link tree](http://dylankenneally.com/).

## notes

The minimal theme I picked came from <https://github.com/orderedlist/minimal>, switched to <https://github.com/pages-themes/minimal> (recent-ish updates, has a community and doco).

## Findings

- the style sheet does look to have been imported
- the id I set in index isn't present
- the download buttons seem - yeah, nah
- the Hosted on GitHub Pages  tag line overlaps stuff above it when window small
- there's a lot of css in https://dylankenneally.github.io/assets/css/style.css?v=abe0ed207f1aadcb2d7d89f39ec1b7a6d291a1f8/s2.css - as in, not used?
- mobile looks ok, ish
