GitHub Pages for https://dylankenneally.github.io - exploring, experimenting, nothing of merit.

I doubt there will be much of interest code wise in this repo, I'm simple using it to explore [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) & the
automation pipeline in GitHub. Anything interesting will be highlighted in the site that's deployed from here.
