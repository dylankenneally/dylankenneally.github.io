# [dylankenneally.github.io](https://dylankenneally.github.io/)

[GitHub pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages) experiments with  [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). Nothing to see here.

This repo is just a playground to help me get familiar with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and the updated automation pipeline in GitHub.

Anything interesting will be shown in the site that gets [deployed from this repo](https://dylankenneally.github.io/).

More interest thank this would be my [site](https://www.dylankenneally.com) & my [link tree](http://dylankenneally.com/).

## notes

The minimal theme I picked came from <https://github.com/orderedlist/minimal>, switched to <https://github.com/pages-themes/minimal> (recent-ish updates, has a community and doco).

## Findings
